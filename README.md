# University of Regina Academic Schedule
### Laura Cookson, James Kress, Eric Lindemann, Rupkatha Manzur, Shevon Wellington

#### Problem Description: 
The current interface for students, faculty and staff (users) to get important dates in a given semester is a PDF that contains the entire academic year at a glance. Unfortunately, the information for the Fall and Winter semesters is far from the row labels, as there are eight columns for the Spring/Summer semesters, making it difficult for users to find the information they need for Fall or Winter.

The webpage project we will create will be a new user interface that will make the academic schedule easier to use and understand. Further, we will add a database where the administration staff member(s) who run this page can add new years, edit existing years, and delete previous years' academic schedules as required. 

In addition to the above, we will be adding some additional functionality. The default view for users will be the information for the current semester based on the current date, with the option to select a different academic year and look at the other semesters. Another functionality will be the ability to switch the view from a semester at a glance to a monthly view containing all the relevant information occurring in a given month, which will also default to the current month based on the current date.
